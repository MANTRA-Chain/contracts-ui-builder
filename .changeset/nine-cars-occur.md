feat: Aligned the contract definition input with the new `code-editor` component and standardized the input field ID to `contractSchema` for consistency with other adapters. This is a breaking change as it renames the `contractInterface` form field to `contractSchema`. The contract address input type has also been updated to `blockchain-address`.
