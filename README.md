## Architecture

The application uses a modular, domain-driven adapter pattern to support multiple blockchain ecosystems. For a detailed explanation of the adapter architecture and module responsibilities, please see the **[Adapter Architecture Guide](./docs/ADAPTER_ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

**Key Components:**

- **Core**: Chain-agnostic application logic, UI components, and the export system. It includes:
  - The `ecosystemManager.ts` for discovering network configurations and adapter capabilities.
- **Adapters (`packages/adapter-*`)**: Individual packages containing chain-specific implementations (e.g., `EvmAdapter`, `SolanaAdapter`). Each adapter conforms to the common `ContractAdapter` interface defined in `packages/types`. Adapters are instantiated with a specific `NetworkConfig`, making them network-aware. The `core` package (via providers from `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-react-core`) dynamically loads and uses these adapters. Furthermore, adapters can optionally provide UI-specific functionalities:
  - **React UI Context Provider** (e.g., for `wagmi/react` on EVM): `WalletStateProvider` (from `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-react-core`) consumes this to set up the necessary app-wide context for the active adapter.
  - **Facade Hooks** (e.g., `useAccount`, `useSwitchChain`): These are exposed by `WalletStateProvider` (via `useWalletState().walletFacadeHooks` from `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-react-core`) for UI components to interact with wallet functionalities reactively and agnostically.
  - **Standardized UI Components** (e.g., `ConnectButton`): These components are retrieved via `activeAdapter.getEcosystemWalletComponents()` and are expected to internally use the facade hooks.
- **Form Renderer**: Shared library containing form rendering components and common utilities (like logging).
- **Types**: Shared TypeScript type definitions across all packages, including the crucial `ContractAdapter` interface and types for adapter UI enhancements.
- **Styling System**: Centralized CSS variables and styling approach used across all packages.

This architecture allows for easy extension to support additional blockchain ecosystems without modifying the core application logic. The `core` package dynamically loads and uses adapters via `ecosystemManager.ts` and the provider model (from `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-react-core`) and the export system includes the specific adapter package needed for the target chain in exported forms. It utilizes **custom Vite plugins** to create **virtual modules**, enabling reliable loading of shared assets (like configuration files between packages) across package boundaries, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and exported builds.

### Adapter Pattern Enforcement

To maintain the integrity of the adapter pattern, this project includes:

- **Custom ESLint Rule**: Enforces that adapter implementations only include methods defined in the `ContractAdapter` interface
- **Automated Validation**: The `lint:adapters` command automatically discovers and validates all adapter implementations
- **CI Integration**: Adapter pattern compliance is checked on every pull request
- **Pre-Push Hook**: Prevents pushing code that violates the adapter pattern

These enforcement mechanisms ensure that the adapter interface remains the single source of truth for adapter implementations, preventing interface drift and maintaining architectural consistency.

For more detailed documentation about the adapter pattern, implementation guidelines, and validation rules, see the documentation within the [`packages/types/src/adapters/base.ts`](./packages/types/src/adapters/base.ts) file where the `ContractAdapter` interface is defined.

## Component Architecture

The project follows a structured component architecture centered around form rendering:

### Form Renderer Components

The form-renderer package provides the core `TransactionForm` component for rendering transaction forms. It dynamically selects and renders appropriate field components using its `DynamicFormField` component. The actual UI primitives and field component implementations (like `TextField`, `AddressField`, `Button`, `Input`) are sourced from the `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-ui` package.

These field components are designed to work exclusively with React Hook Form and are orchestrated by `DynamicFormField`.

### Storybook Integration

The project uses Storybook 8 for component documentation and development:

```bash
# Start Storybook at the root level
pnpm storybook

# Or start Storybook for a specific package
pnpm --filter=@openzeppelin/transaction-form-renderer storybook
```

Storybook stories are organized to:

- Document component usage and API
- Showcase different component states and variations
- Provide interactive examples for development
- Serve as visual regression tests

Stories are located in the `stories` directory of each package, with form-renderer components having the most comprehensive documentation.

## Code Style

### Git Hooks

This project uses Husky to enforce code quality using Git hooks:

- **pre-commit**: Runs lint-staged to format and lint staged files (Prettier first, then ESLint)
- **pre-push**: Runs comprehensive linting and formatting before pushing to remote
- **commit-msg**: Enforces conventional commit message format

These hooks ensure that code pushed to the repository maintains consistent quality and style.

### CSS Class Name Sorting

For consistent CSS class name sorting in Tailwind CSS, always run Prettier first, then ESLint:

```bash
# Recommended approach (runs formatting, then linting)
pnpm fix-all
```

This approach ensures that Tailwind CSS classes are consistently sorted by the prettier-plugin-tailwindcss plugin and prevents conflicts between formatting and linting tools.

### Shared Prettier Configuration

This project uses a single, shared Prettier configuration at the root of the monorepo. Individual packages **should not** include their own `.prettierrc` files. The root configuration includes:

- Common code style settings (single quotes, semi-colons, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS class sorting via prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
- Configuration for special utility functions like `cva`, `cn`, `clsx`, and `twMerge`

To format all packages:

```bash
pnpm format
```

### Import Sorting

Imports are automatically sorted in the following order:

1. React and related packages
2. External packages
3. Internal packages (alias imports starting with `@/`)
4. Parent imports (starting with `..`)
5. Other relative imports (starting with `.`)
6. Style imports
7. Type imports

This ordering is enforced by ESLint and automatically fixed on commit.

## Dependency Management

This project uses several tools to manage dependencies effectively:

- **pnpm**: Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **check-deps script**: Custom utility to identify deprecated dependencies
- **update-deps script**: Easily update all dependencies to their latest versions
- **Dependencies workflow**: Regular checks for outdated dependencies
- **Update Dependencies workflow**: Weekly automated updates

### Checking for Outdated Dependencies

To see which dependencies are outdated:

```bash
pnpm outdated
```

### Updating Dependencies

For regular updates (respecting semver):

```bash
pnpm update-deps
```

For major version updates (may include breaking changes):

```bash
pnpm update-deps:major
```

### Automated Updates

The project is configured with:

1. **Update Dependencies workflow**: Runs weekly to check for and apply updates

## Adding New Adapters

To add support for a new blockchain ecosystem:

1.  **Create Package**: Create a new directory `packages/adapter-<chain-name>` (e.g., `packages/adapter-sui`).
2.  **Define `package.json`**:
    - Set the package name (e.g., `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-adapter-sui`).
    - Add a dependency on `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-types` (`workspace:*`).
    - Add any chain-specific SDKs or libraries required by the adapter.
    - Include standard build scripts (refer to existing adapter packages).
    - **Important**: Ensure your package exports a named array of its `NetworkConfig[]` objects (e.g., `export const suiNetworks = [...]`) and its main `Adapter` class from its entry point (`src/index.ts`).
3.  **Define `tsconfig.json`**: Create a `tsconfig.json` extending the root `tsconfig.base.json`.
4.  **Implement Adapter**:
    - Create `src/adapter.ts`.
    - Import `ContractAdapter`, the specific `YourEcosystemNetworkConfig` (e.g., `SuiNetworkConfig`), and related types from `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-types`.
    - Implement the `ContractAdapter` interface. The constructor **must** accept its specific `NetworkConfig` (e.g., `constructor(networkConfig: SuiNetworkConfig)`).
    - Implement methods to use `this.networkConfig` internally for network-specific operations (e.g., initializing HTTP clients with RPC URLs from the config).
5.  **Define Network Configurations**:\
    - Create `src/networks/mainnet.ts`, `testnet.ts`, etc., defining `YourEcosystemNetworkConfig` objects for each supported network.
    - Each network config must provide all necessary details for the adapter to function, such as RPC endpoints (`rpcUrl` or `rpcEndpoint`), chain identifiers (`chainId` for EVM), explorer URLs, native currency details, etc., as defined by its `YourEcosystemNetworkConfig` interface.
    - Create `src/networks/index.ts` to export the combined list of networks (e.g., `export const suiNetworks = [...mainnetSuiNetworks, ...testnetSuiNetworks];`) and also export each network configuration individually by its constant name (e.g., `export { suiMainnet, suiTestnet } from './mainnet';`).
6.  **Export Adapter & Networks**: Create `src/index.ts` in your adapter package and export the adapter class (e.g., `export { SuiAdapter } from './adapter';`) and the main networks array (e.g., `export { suiNetworks } from './networks';`). It's also good practice to re-export individual network configurations from the adapter's main entry point if they might be directly imported by consumers.
7.  **Register Ecosystem in Core**:
    - Open `packages/core/src/core/ecosystemManager.ts`.
    - Import the new adapter class (e.g., `import { SuiAdapter } from '@openzeppelin/transaction-form-adapter-sui';`).
    - Add a new entry to the `ecosystemRegistry` object. This entry defines:
      - `networksExportName`: The string name of the exported network list (e.g., 'suiNetworks'). This is used by the `EcosystemManager` to dynamically load all network configurations for an ecosystem.
      - `AdapterClass`: The constructor of your adapter (e.g., `SuiAdapter as AnyAdapterConstructor`).
    - Add a case for your new ecosystem in the `switch` statement within `loadAdapterPackageModule` to enable dynamic import of your adapter package module (which should export the `AdapterClass` and the `networksExportName` list).
    - Note: If the adapter requires specific package dependencies for _exported projects_ (beyond its own runtime dependencies), these are typically managed by the `PackageManager` configuration within the adapter package itself (e.g., an `adapter.config.ts` file exporting dependency details).
8.  **Workspace**: Ensure the new package is included in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (if not covered by `packages/*`).
9.  **Build & Test**:
    - Build the new adapter package (`pnpm --filter @openzeppelin/transaction-form-adapter-<chain-name> build`).
    - Add relevant unit/integration tests.
    - Ensure the core application (`pnpm --filter @openzeppelin/transaction-form-builder-core build`) and the export system still function correctly.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery:

- **CI Workflow**: Runs tests, linting, and type checking for all packages
- **Coverage Workflow**: Generates and uploads test coverage reports
- **Release Workflow**: Manages semantic versioning and releases for the main application
- **Form-Renderer Publish Workflow**: Builds and tests the form-renderer package automatically when changes are merged to main
- **Security Workflow**: Checks for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependencies Workflow**: Checks for outdated dependencies
- **Update Dependencies Workflow**: Automatically updates dependencies

### Package Publishing

> **Note**: Automatic publishing is currently disabled during early development. The workflow is configured but commented out until the package is
> ready for production release.

The form-renderer package will be automatically published to npm when changes are merged to the main branch once publishing is enabled. Currently,
the workflow only builds and tests the package without publishing.

The publishing process (when enabled):

1. Runs when code is pushed to the main branch or via manual trigger
2. Runs tests and builds the package
3. Uses semantic-release to determine the next version based on commit messages
4. Publishes to npm with appropriate tags
5. Creates a GitHub release with generated release notes

Manual releases can be triggered through the GitHub Actions interface with a version parameter when needed during development.

## Monorepo Configuration

This project uses a centralized configuration approach to maintain consistency across all packages:

### Shared Configurations

- **tailwind.config.cjs**: Root configuration for Tailwind CSS, used by all packages
- **postcss.config.cjs**: Root configuration for PostCSS, used by all packages
- **components.json**: Root configuration for shadcn/ui components, used by all packages

Each package has symlinks to these root configuration files, ensuring consistent styling, processing, and component behavior across the entire
monorepo.

### Symlink Structure

To ensure consistency, the following packages use symlinks pointing to the root configuration files (`tailwind.config.cjs`, `postcss.config.cjs`, `components.json`):

- **Core Package**: Links to root configuration files.
- **Form Renderer Package**: Links to root configuration files.
- **Styles Package**: Links to root configuration files.

During the export process, these symlinks are resolved to create standalone configuration files with the appropriate settings for the exported
project.

## Runtime Configuration

Both the core Transaction Form Builder application and its exported forms support runtime configuration for certain parameters. This is primarily managed via an `AppConfigService` and allows customization without rebuilding the application code.

### Core Application Configuration (Development)

During development of the core application, configurations are typically provided via Vite environment variables defined in `.env` files (e.g., `.env.local`). These variables usually follow a prefix like `VITE_APP_CFG_...`.

Key configurable items include:

- **Explorer API Keys:** For services like Etherscan, PolygonScan, etc., used by adapters to fetch ABIs. Example: `VITE_APP_CFG_API_KEY_ETHERSCAN_MAINNET="your_key"`.
- **WalletConnect Project ID:** For EVM adapter's WalletConnect functionality. Example: `VITE_APP_CFG_SERVICE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID="your_id"`.
- **RPC URL Overrides:** To use custom RPC endpoints instead of public defaults for specific networks. Example: `VITE_APP_CFG_RPC_ENDPOINT_ETHEREUM_MAINNET="https://your_custom_rpc.com"`.

### Exported Application Configuration

Exported forms include a `public/app.config.json` file. Users of the exported form should edit this file to provide their own API keys and RPC URLs.

The structure of this JSON file includes sections for:

- `networkServiceConfigs`: For explorer API keys, keyed by a service identifier (e.g., `"etherscan-mainnet"`).
- `globalServiceConfigs`: For global service parameters (e.g., `walletconnect.projectId`).
- `rpcEndpoints`: For RPC URL overrides, keyed by the network ID (e.g., `"ethereum-mainnet"`).

Refer to the README included with the exported application for detailed instructions on configuring `public/app.config.json`.

### Adding/Modifying Networks

When adding new EVM network definitions (in `packages/adapter-evm/src/networks/`), ensure you define:

- `id`: A unique string identifier (e.g., "my-custom-chain-mainnet").
- `chainId`: The numeric EVM chain ID.
- `rpcUrl`: A default public RPC URL.
- `primaryExplorerApiIdentifier`: A string (e.g., "mychainscan-mainnet") that will be used as the key in `app.config.json`'s `networkServiceConfigs` if this network's explorer requires an API key for ABI fetching.
- `apiUrl` and `explorerUrl` for the block explorer.

If this network is also to be a chain-switchable target within Wagmi (for the EVM adapter), you may need to update the `defaultSupportedChains` array and the `viemChainIdToAppNetworkIdMap` in `packages/adapter-evm/src/wallet/wagmi-implementation.ts` to ensure RPC overrides from `app.config.json` apply correctly to Wagmi's transports for this chain.
