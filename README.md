## Architecture

The application uses an adapter pattern to support multiple blockchain ecosystems:

- **Core**: Chain-agnostic components, types, and utilities
- **Adapters**: Chain-specific implementations that conform to a common interface
- **UI Components**: React components that use adapters to interact with different blockchains
- **Styling System**: Centralized CSS variables and styling approach used across all packages

This architecture allows for easy extension to support additional blockchain ecosystems without modifying the core application logic.

### Adapter Pattern Enforcement

To maintain the integrity of the adapter pattern, this project includes:

- **Custom ESLint Rule**: Enforces that adapter implementations only include methods defined in the `ContractAdapter` interface
- **Automated Validation**: The `lint:adapters` command automatically discovers and validates all adapter implementations
- **CI Integration**: Adapter pattern compliance is checked on every pull request
- **Pre-Push Hook**: Prevents pushing code that violates the adapter pattern

These enforcement mechanisms ensure that the adapter interface remains the single source of truth for adapter implementations, preventing interface drift and maintaining architectural consistency.

For more detailed documentation about the adapter pattern, implementation guidelines, and validation rules, see the [Adapter System documentation](./packages/core/src/adapters/README.md).

## Component Architecture

The project follows a structured component architecture centered around form rendering:

### Form Renderer Components

The form-renderer package provides a set of specialized components:

- **TransactionForm**: The main entry point for rendering transaction forms
- **DynamicFormField**: Renders appropriate field components based on field type
- **Field Components**: Specialized field implementations (TextField, NumberField, AddressField, etc.)

These components are designed to work exclusively with React Hook Form and should not be used standalone. All field components should be rendered through the DynamicFormField component, which handles field type mapping and validation integration.

### Storybook Integration

The project uses Storybook 8 for component documentation and development:

```bash
# Start Storybook at the root level
pnpm storybook

# Or start Storybook for a specific package
pnpm --filter=@openzeppelin/transaction-form-builder-form-renderer storybook
```

Storybook stories are organized to:

- Document component usage and API
- Showcase different component states and variations
- Provide interactive examples for development
- Serve as visual regression tests

Stories are located in the `stories` directory of each package, with form-renderer components having the most comprehensive documentation.

## Code Style

### Git Hooks

This project uses Husky to enforce code quality using Git hooks:

- **pre-commit**: Runs lint-staged to format and lint staged files (Prettier first, then ESLint)
- **pre-push**: Runs comprehensive linting and formatting before pushing to remote
- **commit-msg**: Enforces conventional commit message format

These hooks ensure that code pushed to the repository maintains consistent quality and style.

### CSS Class Name Sorting

For consistent CSS class name sorting in Tailwind CSS, always run Prettier first, then ESLint:

```bash
# Recommended approach (runs formatting, then linting)
pnpm fix-all
```

This approach ensures that Tailwind CSS classes are consistently sorted by the prettier-plugin-tailwindcss plugin and prevents conflicts between formatting and linting tools.

### Shared Prettier Configuration

This project uses a single, shared Prettier configuration at the root of the monorepo. Individual packages **should not** include their own `.prettierrc` files. The root configuration includes:

- Common code style settings (single quotes, semi-colons, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS class sorting via prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
- Configuration for special utility functions like `cva`, `cn`, `clsx`, and `twMerge`

To format all packages:

```bash
pnpm format
```

### Import Sorting

Imports are automatically sorted in the following order:

1. React and related packages
2. External packages
3. Internal packages (alias imports starting with `@/`)
4. Parent imports (starting with `..`)
5. Other relative imports (starting with `.`)
6. Style imports
7. Type imports

This ordering is enforced by ESLint and automatically fixed on commit.

## Dependency Management

This project uses several tools to manage dependencies effectively:

- **pnpm**: Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **check-deps script**: Custom utility to identify deprecated dependencies
- **update-deps script**: Easily update all dependencies to their latest versions
- **Dependencies workflow**: Regular checks for outdated dependencies
- **Update Dependencies workflow**: Weekly automated updates

### Checking for Outdated Dependencies

To see which dependencies are outdated:

```bash
pnpm outdated
```

### Updating Dependencies

For regular updates (respecting semver):

```bash
pnpm update-deps
```

For major version updates (may include breaking changes):

```bash
pnpm update-deps:major
```

### Automated Updates

The project is configured with:

1. **Update Dependencies workflow**: Runs weekly to check for and apply updates

## Commit Convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). See [COMMIT_CONVENTION.md](./COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) for more details.

Example:

```
feat(ui): add button component
```

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.

## Security

Please read [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for details on our security policy and how to report vulnerabilities.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery:

- **CI Workflow**: Runs tests, linting, and type checking for all packages
- **Coverage Workflow**: Generates and uploads test coverage reports
- **Release Workflow**: Manages semantic versioning and releases for the main application
- **Form-Renderer Publish Workflow**: Builds and tests the form-renderer package automatically when changes are merged to main
- **Security Workflow**: Checks for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependencies Workflow**: Checks for outdated dependencies
- **Update Dependencies Workflow**: Automatically updates dependencies

### Package Publishing

> **Note**: Automatic publishing is currently disabled during early development. The workflow is configured but commented out until the package is ready for production release.

The form-renderer package will be automatically published to npm when changes are merged to the main branch once publishing is enabled. Currently, the workflow only builds and tests the package without publishing.

The publishing process (when enabled):

1. Runs when code is pushed to the main branch or via manual trigger
2. Runs tests and builds the package
3. Uses semantic-release to determine the next version based on commit messages
4. Publishes to npm with appropriate tags
5. Creates a GitHub release with generated release notes

Manual releases can be triggered through the GitHub Actions interface with a version parameter when needed during development.

## Monorepo Configuration

This project uses a centralized configuration approach to maintain consistency across all packages:

### Shared Configurations

- **tailwind.config.cjs**: Root configuration for Tailwind CSS, used by all packages
- **postcss.config.cjs**: Root configuration for PostCSS, used by all packages
- **components.json**: Root configuration for shadcn/ui components, used by all packages

Each package has symlinks to these root configuration files, ensuring consistent styling, processing, and component behavior across the entire monorepo.

### Symlink Structure

- **Core Package**: Links to root configuration files (../../config.cjs)
- **Form Renderer Package**: Links to root configuration files (../../config.cjs)

During the export process, these symlinks are resolved to create standalone configuration files with the appropriate settings for the exported project.
