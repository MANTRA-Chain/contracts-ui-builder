# Midnight Adapter (`@openzeppelin/transaction-form-adapter-midnight`)

This package provides the `ContractAdapter` implementation for the Midnight Network within the Transaction Form Builder ecosystem.

**Note:** This adapter is currently a placeholder implementation. Functionality will be added in future development phases as the Midnight Network evolves.

It _will_ handle:

- Loading Midnight contract metadata.
- Mapping Midnight types to form fields.
- Parsing user input for transactions.
- Formatting query results.
- Interacting with Midnight wallets.
- Providing Midnight-specific configuration.

## Internal Structure

This adapter will follow the standard domain-driven module structure outlined in the main [Adapter Architecture Guide](../../docs/ADAPTER_ARCHITECTURE.md).
