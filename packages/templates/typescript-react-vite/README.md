## Customizing the Form

The form is defined in `src/components/GeneratedForm.tsx` and uses the form schema that was generated during export. You can customize the form's appearance and behavior by editing this file.

## Form Renderer

This application uses the `@openzeppelin/transaction-form-renderer` package to render the form. For more information, see the [documentation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/transaction-form-builder).
